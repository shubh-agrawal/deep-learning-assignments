So for any future predicitions we can trust he model to be right for approximately 80%. Note that any term like \"atleast 80%\" or \"atmost 80%\" is not used as it will be still unprobable if the model can give 100% accuracy or 50% accuracy for future predicitions. However, the accuracy obtained on the test cases can represent a good measure for performance metric for the model.\n",
    "- 2) From the images and their corresponding predicition, it is clearly understood that the model is trying to give result by giving more importance to background scene. In the given images, the wolves are found to be in snow clad region which gives their background scene a bright essence. Contrary to that, the background of husky is found to be mostly dry barren land region. The model predicts an image with husky in 9th image as its background seems to be dry and barren. Similarly in 6th image, husky is predicted to be a wolf as the background for the images seems to be snow claded. Interestingly, whenever husky and wolf are switched in their respective environement, the system fails to give the correct result.\n",

The features include the background scene information (color, texture) and some body patches of the animal.

A neural network in this case would be more trusted if its looks into more deep features that are independednt to environment conditions and does not generalise to both the animals.
